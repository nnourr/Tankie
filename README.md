# Tankie
A WiFi controlled raspberryPi car

Project Description:
The Tankie is a rasberryPi wifi controlled car/robot that can show live video display onto the website which also hosts the controls for the car in real time. The car has a couple key components that allow it to be controlled. To begin the base of the car holds all the modules on it. the major componet included on the car is the RasberryPi 4. It was the basis of our entire projject. The motors connected to it allow for the wheels to spi with accurate power based on user input. The dual moters give full 360 directional control for the vehichle. This is also possible in part because of the tracks that give the car the capability to climb small hights and move through snow as displayed. A fan occupies a central roll to the Pi as without it the car would constanly overheat and stop operating. Homemade battery packs allow for the motors to be powered effienctly while a recharable standard battery pack keeps the Pi up and running 24/7 so that a user (with password) can control the Pi anywhere in the world 24 hour a day. the car its self is controlled on the website where you may see a demo. The camera is also connected to the pi and is operational to display a live feed of what our tankie is seeing. All these components are done through Flask and Ajax requests. the code for the movment of the car is done in python and the website is done through standard HTML CSS and JavaScript.

contact one of us for acsess than enter password use your keyboard WASD or click the buttons on screen themselves in order to use the pi. once paswarod is entered instead of the video you will get the real time video feed in the same section and the control will apear there as well. Further down the website you can see some images of the car as well as links to our contact inforamtion of the team and really get to know us and our tankie 

Design:

created using the engineering design process, we used bits and pieces of different styles of programming main featuring ensemble programing with a agile method as things weren't always goin in our favour. 

Problems faced:

In particular our camera broke in the installation process and when doing so we had to reallign our plan in order to work around shippin days. with this our focus shifted towards the website until the new camera was delivered. 
through this project we took to combing our skill to create and more importantly learn about the many differrent aspects to coding. with this project we gained knowledge on serveral integal parts of our coding careers. gaining information from things such as setting up a website on its own host server to video editing. another focal one would be working ina team and how to uild upon eachother strength to collaborate and be effective in our production
